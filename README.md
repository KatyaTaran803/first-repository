# First-Repository
My first repository
Hi, everyone. My Python\`s Road begun with this repository. I am very glad that I was lucky to get acquainted with such a wonderful tool. The features and the community of this language are incredible. In this folder I will upload my answers to various test tasks on Python. My solutions are far from perfect. I do this only so that people who cannot solve these tasks by themselves, could use my prompts. Because I used to do the same a long time ago. And yet I hope that my answers will be used only as a last resort.
